History
-------
0.11 ( 9 Aug 2003) If the RISC OS 5 HAL is available (or HAL26 module is loaded)
                   ultra-light noise generation tries to call HAL_ReadCounter to                    get more entropy from the IOC's timer.  Should increase the
                   randomness of multiple calls within a few centiseconds of
                   each other.

0.10r2 (30 Jan 03) Moved into !System directory (module unchanged)
0.10 (19 Jan 2003) 32-bit mode compatible version


0.09 ( 3 Nov 2002) Fixed security hole in CryptRandom_Block, where if a block
                   larger than the randomness pool was requested, only the first
                   randomness-pool's-worth would be filled in

     ( 3 Nov 2002) SECURITY ADVISORY 20021103 RECOMMENDS UPGRADE TO 0.09

0.08 ( 6 Mar 2002) Added CryptRandom_Word SWI

0.07 (26 Jan 2001) Added CryptRandomLicence command to display licence conditions

0.06 (16 Jan 2001) Split SHA digest creation into SHA1 module

0.05 ( 3 Jan 2001) Added CryptRandom_Block SWI

0.04 ( 1 Jan 2001) Now saves seed on Service_Shutdown (finalisation code
                   may not be called on normal shutdown).  Error giving
                   wrong SWI numbers in documentation corrected.
                   Added computation of SHA message digests.

0.03 (12 Dec 2000) Fixed problem where double clicks were being lost on
                   some machines (first click was reading second from
                   mouse queue, and so clearing it)

0.02 (12 Nov 2000) Changed seed path from Choices:CryptRand.Seed to
                   Choices:Crypto.CryptRand.Seed to fit in with SSHProxy
	
0.01 ( 1 Sep 2000) First version
