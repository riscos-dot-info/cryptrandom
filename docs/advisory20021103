Security advisory for CryptRandom module

Affected:             CryptRandom module
Susceptible versions: 0.05 to 0.08 inclusive
Fixed in:             0.09

Stefan Bellon discovered a bug in CryptRandom, a module for generating
cryptographically useful random numbers.  This module is used by, among
others, GnuPG, SSHProxy and pscp - none of these, nor any other applications
the author is aware of, are affected, but you are advised to upgrade this
module in any case.  Version 0.09 can be downloaded from
http://www.markettos.org.uk/ and new versions of SSHProxy and pscp have been
issued containing it (see below for those).

The bug concerns the CryptRandom_Block SWI, which is used to generate a block
of random bytes.  In certain circumstances when requesting a block of random
numbers, only the first part of the block is filled in.  This means that a)
the data returned may become predictable and b) the preexisting data in the
block is returned as random data.  Predictability may affect algorithms
which rely on the unpredictability of the random data for their
security, such as DSA encryption in SSH (this is not used by SSHProxy).
The effects of the leak of data from memory depends on the use to which the
caller puts it.  It may, for example, be exposed to the network or other
applications.

The bug may be triggered if more than 2 to 1200 bytes of randomness are
requested - the exact threshold depends on the state of the randomness pool
within CryptRandom.



SSHProxy 0.18 and pscp 0.49b-07 contain the fixed module.  SSHProxy also
contains memory leak fixes (thanks to Justin Fletcher) and sets the IP type
of service flags for low delay transmission - this may help speed interactive
data through congested networks.  Both are also available from
